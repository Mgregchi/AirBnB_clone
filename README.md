# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console


`Group project` `Python` `OOP`

## Concepts

For this project, we expect you to look at these concepts:

- Python packages
- AirBnB clone



## Background Context
### Welcome to the AirBnB clone project!
Before starting, please read the **AirBnB** concept page.

![AirBnB-Overview](https://youtu.be/XRH_8w1DEGI)

### First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects.

This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration…

Each task is linked and will help you to:

- put in place a parent class (called `BaseModel`) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
- create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
- create all classes used for AirBnB (`User`, `State`, `City`, `Place`…) that inherit from `BaseModel`
- create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
- create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

### What’s a command interpreter?

Do you remember the Shell? It’s exactly the same but limited to a specific use-case. In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

## General Requirements

### Python Scripts

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version `3.8.5`)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)

A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

### Python Unit Tests

- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your test files should be python files (extension: `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start by `test_`
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project
e.g., For `models/base_model.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
e.g., For `models/user.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_user.py`
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)

## More Info
### Execution
Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)
```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```

All tests should also pass in non-interactive mode: `$ echo "python3 -m unittest discover tests" | bash`

## Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project where we worked on the backend of the project whiles interfacing it with a console application with the help of the cmd module in python.

Data (python objects) generated are stored in a json file and can be accessed with the help of the json module in python

## Description of the command interpreter:
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter  serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object

## How to start it
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine (Linux distro) for development and testing purposes.

## Installing

You will need to clone the repository of the project from Github. This will contain the simple shell program and all of its dependencies.

```
git clone https://github.com/sotoriz/AirBnB_clone.git
```
After cloning the repository you will have a folder called AirBnB_clone. In here there will be several files that allow the program to work.

> /console.py : The main executable of the project, the command interpreter.
>
> models/engine/file_storage.py: Class that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances
>
> models/__ init __.py:  A unique `FileStorage` instance for the application
>
> models/base_model.py: Class that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes.
>
> models/user.py: User class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/state.py: State class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/city.py: City class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/amenity.py: Amenity class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/place.py: Place class that inherits from BaseModel
>
>models/review.py: Review class that inherits from BaseModel



## How to use it
It can work in two different modes:


**Interactive** and **Non-interactive**.

In **Interactive mode**, the console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
```

In **Non-interactive mode**, the shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.


```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
```

## Format of Command Input

In order to give commands to the console, these will need to be piped through an echo in case of  **Non-interactive mode**.

In  **Interactive Mode**  the commands will need to be written with a keyboard when the prompt appears and will be recognized when an enter key is pressed (new line). As soon as this happens, the console will attempt to execute the command through several means or will show an error message if the command didn't run successfully. In this mode, the console can be exited using the **CTRL + D** combination,  **CTRL + C**, or the command **quit** or **EOF**.

## Arguments

Most commands have several options or arguments that can be used when executing the program. In order for the Shell to recognize those parameters, the user must separate everything with spaces.

Example:

```

user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create BaseModel
49faff9a-6318-451f-87b6-910505c55907
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py

```

or

```
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py $ echo "create BaseModel" | ./console.py
(hbnb)
e37ebcd3-f8e1-4c1f-8095-7a019070b1fa
(hbnb)
user@ubuntu:~/AirBnB$ ./console.py
```
